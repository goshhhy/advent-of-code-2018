ky0ko's advent of code 2018
===========================

hi, i'm participating in advent of code this year

i'm putting my solutions here

probably don't read them if you want to participate and haven't
already solved the problem!

i didn't start until the end of day 1, so my day 1 rank
is a bit bad but that's okay

notes on the code
=================

my solutions are generally not modified or only slightly modified 
from when i used them to solve the puzzle

usually it's just printfs that i change after the fact, to make it
more whimsical - i leave the structure / logic of the program alone

the solutions are written in c, which is the programming language
that i am most comfortable with (it's been my primary programming
language since i was 11)

each puzzle has its own folder, 1-1 for day one puzzle one, 5-2 for
day 5 puzzle 2, and so on

the folder contains my (sometimes hamd-modified) input for that day, 
a single c file, a makefile, and probably the executable (built for
linux x86_64 on glibc 2.28)

my stats:
=========

| day 	| part 1 time	| part 1 rank 	| part 2 time	| part 2 rank	|
| ----- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1  	| 22:54:58		| 24747			| 23:30:33		| 20204			|
| 2		| 00:15:54		| 1349			| 00:30:30		| 1260			|
| 3		| 00:09:50		| 273			| 00:13:25		| 200			|
